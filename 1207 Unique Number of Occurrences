Problem:
Given an array of integers arr, write a function that returns true if and only if the number of occurrences of 
each value in the array is unique.

Example1 : Input: arr = [1,2,2,1,1,3]
Output: true
Explanation: The value 1 has 3 occurrences, 2 has 2 and 3 has 1. No two values have the same number of occurrences.

思路： 还是用set() to count() the frequency of number of occurence. 

class Solution:
    def uniqueOccurrences(self, arr: List[int]) -> bool:
        fre = []
        for a in set(arr):
            if not arr.count(a) in fre:
                fre.append(arr.count(a))
            else: return False 
        return True
        
Notify: if not.... in fre:(if arr.count(a) is not in fre, then do)
        if it is already in, return False as the result,
        if the loop successfully append all the element into the array, then return successful.
