难度：Easy
##这道题没什么难度，但是从看答案学到了一个新的工具：Counter
example:
  from collections import Counter as C
  a = "aaaAA"
  c = C(a)
  print(c)
  
  会print出来：Counter({'a': 3, 'A': 2})
  
#回到这道题
You're given strings J representing the types of stones that are jewels, and S representing the stones you have.  
Each character in S is a type of stone you have.  You want to know how many of the stones you have are also jewels.

The letters in J are guaranteed distinct, and all characters in J and S are letters. Letters are case sensitive,
so "a" is considered a different type of stone from "A".

Input: J = "aA", S = "aAAbbbb"
Output: 3

##感觉不用Counter，主要是因为不知道怎么把'a' 'A'两个加起来，于是就用笨办法了

class Solution:
    def numJewelsInStones(self, J: str, S: str) -> int:
        count = 0
        for stone in S:
            if stone in J:
                count +=1 
        return count
